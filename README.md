# Description

This project is the exploration of some basic features of react-admin(https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) which is a 
frontend framework for building admin applications running in the browser.

Additionally, json-server(https://github.com/typicode/json-server) has been used to simulate a backend REST service and deliver 
the data in JSON format.
